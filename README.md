# Height profile approximation

## Project Description

The project focuses on the implementation and analysis of two interpolation approximation methods: Lagrange and a method using third-degree glued functions.
The goal is to approximate the elevation profile of selected routes based on real data and to investigate which method is most suitable for this type of analysis.

## Technologies

The project was implemented using Python and the following libraries:

- `pandas` for loading stock data from a CSV file,
- `matplotlib` for visualizing results by drawing charts.

## Data

All data were taken from [geocontext.org][def]

[def]: https://geocontext.org/

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imwrdo/height-profile-approximation.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas | pip install matplotlib
```
